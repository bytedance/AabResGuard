# Data of size savings
**AabResGuard** was developed in June 2019 and launched at the end of July 2019 in several overseas products such as `Tiktok`, `Vigo`.
Provides resource protection and package size optimization capabilities for overseas products.

At present, no feedback has been received on related resources. Due to some reasons for the R&D process, **AabResGuard** is supported by additional commands based on resource obfuscation.
It has the ability to run by command line, and provides the `jar` package directly to provide convenient support for `CI`.
The current data of size savings for multiple products is below: 

>Since each application has different levels of optimization for resources, the optimization of the data in different applications is different, and the actual data is subject to change.
